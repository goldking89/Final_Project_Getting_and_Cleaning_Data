## Analysis Description
The Getting and Cleaning Data R Script.R file will work when appropriate working directory is set.

Analysis will read the training and testing data set. Each variables are named accordingly based on the features listed in the features.txt file.

Using the combined data set, a single tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created and named as tidydata.txt file.
